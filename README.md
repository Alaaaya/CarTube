  - Instant paste of any copied YouTube URLs
  - If you were watching something on the YouTube app and then get in the car, it'll pop up on CarTube

## Known Issues
- Videos where the uploader has disabled embedding unfortunately will not work
- Sometimes autoplay may not work, just hit the play button if you get a black screen

  - oh well YT share menu sucks anyway, it's faster to copy the link
