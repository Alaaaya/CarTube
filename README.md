<p align="center">YouTube on CarPlay, no jailbreak required!</p>

## Features
- A full-feature app for YouTube - browse, search, watch videos and more in the car!
- Works on any device supporting [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), no jailbreak required
- No ads
- Skip sponsored segments with SponsorBlock
- System integrations:
  - "Play on CarPlay" share extension
  - Instant paste of any copied YouTube URLs
  - If you were watching something on the YouTube app and then get in the car, it'll pop up on CarTube

## Known Issues
- Playlists will only play the first video
- Does not appear to work if not installed with TrollStore on officially supported versions
- Shorts can be a bit finnicky
- Sometimes autoplay may not work, just hit the play button if you get a black screen
- "Play on CarPlay" share extension works everywhere except the YT app
  - Oh well, YT share menu sucks anyway, it's faster to copy the link
- Possible issues from activating Siri inside the app, nothing major, just may break the screen persistence helper
